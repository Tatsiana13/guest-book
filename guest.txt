I would like to ask which one of the following introductory is more appropriate for a formal and polite registry when I text to someone who knows me for the first time after I got her number or when I text through a different phone number than that I already have been using so in both cases there is someone knows me but cannot recognize my number unless I make my name clear on my text.
